    <p>
        This is the result of a gamejam I did along with 2 other people.
        I wrote all of the code, while my teammates drew the art, designed the levels, and composed the music. <br>
        The time limit for the gamejam was 5 hours! <br><br>
        Here's what I've made:

                This a tile-based puzzle game.
                <br><br>
                You have to navigate your way around a maze filled with obstacles, grabbing ingredients for a delicious cup of tea along the way.
                The tea isn't for you, though. You have to deliver it to the Queen, which is your end goal.
                <br><br>
                Howwwwever! As you pass through an obstacle, it falls over,
                and then you shall not pass again. So you've got to strategically envision which path you'll take so as not to get stuck, or miss out on a crucial ingredient!
                The ingredients/steps towards the completion of your tea are as follows:<br>
                - Get the empty cup<br>
                - Get the boiling water<br>
                - Get the tea<br>
                - And finally.. get some milk. Because who doesn't put milk into their tea
                <br><br>
                <u style="font-weight: lighter">Controls</u><br>
                The controls are very simple, you just use WASD or arrow keys to move around, and you press E to pick-up an ingredient from a nearby table.
                <br><br>
                <u style="font-weight: lighter">Tile-based movement</u><br>
                Once you press a movement key, you'll continue walking in that direction until you reach the middle of the next tile, you cannot stop moving mid-tile, or stand between two tiles.

    <h3>"Attempt Pickup" function</h3><hr>
    <div style="display: flex">

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">
            <p>
                This function is called whenever the player presses E, to attempt to pick up a nearby item.<br><br>
                <pry>Line 5</pry> - I create an array with 4 offsets from the players position- one tile north, east, south and west of the player.<br>These are the 4 places an item may lie at.
                <br><br>
                <pry>Line 11</pry> - In order to do things with tilemaps you have to convert to their cell space.<br>
                <img src="content/TM_CE_1_0.png"> < this is the tilemap that contains all of the objectives (the cup, water, tea, & milk).
                <br><br>
                <pry>Line 14 & 15</pry> - Here I get the name of the item being picked up, convert it to an enum, and set that enum as the value of a property.<br>
                What <code>Prog</code> and <code>Progress</code> are and what they do is covered in the next code example.
