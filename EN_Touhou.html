                You move around with arrow keys, and you use Z to shoot. Holding down Shift lets you move more slowly, and shoot more narrowly.<br>
                Enemies spawn gradually and randomly fly around while shooting circles of bullets.<br>
                You have three lives. Getting hit clears all enemies and bullets off the screen.<br>
                <br>
                I started this project because I wanted to create a game without a game engine and to learn about rendering.<br>
                I've tried <a href ="https://www.glfw.org/faq.html#11---what-is-glfw" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">GLFW</a> before, but I have more experience with C# than with C++, so I decided to use
                <a href="https://opentk.net/faq.html" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">OpenTK</a> instead.<br>
                After watching some videos on Youtube, and reading through the tutorial on the website, I managed to create a simple game like this.

    <!-- First code example -->
    <div style="display: inline-flex">

            This is the main update function.<br>
            Entity is the base class for all of the enemies, bullets, and the player.<br>
            <br>
            Here I go through all of the entities, and then go through all of their components.<br>
            The base class <code>Component</code> itself is completely empty. Everything is up to it's derivative classes;
            <code>Movement-</code>, <code>Bullet-</code>, <code>Sprite-</code>, & <code>EnemyComponent</code>.<br>
            I check for all of the possible component sub-types, and then call the component's <code>Update()</code> function.
            <br><br>
            This was written more than a year ago.<br>
            I recognise now, in hindsight, that <red>this is poor code</red>.<br>
            A better option would've been to create an abstract or virtual <code>Update()</code> function in the base class, and have the sub-classes override it.<br>
            Then, I could simply call that instead, and I could call it regardless of the sub-type, so I wouldn't have to put a bunch of if-statemements.

    <!-- Second code example -->
    <div style="display: inline-flex">
        <img style="height: 100%" src="content/2hu3.png">
        <p style="margin-top: 0">
            This is the <code>Update()</code> function of the <code>BulletComponent</code> component.<br>
            It's called every frame from the main update function, and it handles movement and collision.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 3</pry> - This is the movement. <code>Base</code> is the <code>Entity</code> that this component resides on.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 5</pry> - I loop through a list of all entities. I add <code>.ToList()</code> at the end here to prevent the "Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute" exception.
            You're not allowed to modify lists that are being looped through with foreach, and since entities remove themselves from the list upon being destroyed, that would throw the error.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 7</pry> - Ignore other bullets, and this bullet itself.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 10 & 11</pry> - I attempt to find a <code>HealthComponent</code>, and if that entity doesn't have one, I ignore it.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 14</pry> - I ignore the entity that fired the bullet, so you don't immediately hit yourself when you shoot.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 16</pry> - I check if both the owner of this bullet and the target are an enemy, so that there's no friendly fire between enemies.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 19</pry> - Finally, I check if the bullet's close enough, and if it is, make it deal damage and destroy itself.<br>
            <br><br>
            <red>Issues & possible optimisations</red>:<br>
            At <pry>Line 10</pry> I look through the target's list of components.<br>
            This is more expensive than the other checks I do, so I should've done the other checks first, in case they pass, and only then do this one.<br>
            This also applies to <pry>Line 7</pry>.<br>
            <br>
            All of these checks are ran separately by each bullet, every frame. Instead, I could do these only once when they're necessary.<br>
            I could have a separate list of entities, those qualified to be hit-targets.
            And if I know that entities cannot gain or lose components after being spawned, then I know I only have to check for a HealthComponent once.<br>
            <br>
            At <pry>Line 16</pry> I compare strings, but comparing enums would be more performant.<br>
            I could also create seperate sub-classes to create a distinction between the player and the enemies, and compare those instead.
