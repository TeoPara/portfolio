                This is a multiplayer website for sharing images.<br>
                It's pretty simplistic; there's an upload form where you can select a file and write a comment,
                and below there's a catalog of all other uploads.<br>
                <br>
                Whatever you upload is saved server-side into a folder, and whenever someone connects, the posts are sent over to be loaded.<br>
                If someone else creates a new post while you're watching the catalog, your tab is refreshed.<br>
                The date and time of the uploads' creation is also conveyed.<br>
                <br>
                At the top-left there's a checkbox for 'appreciation mode'.<br>
                This will expand images to full size & darken the backdrop on mouse-over.<br>
                <br>
