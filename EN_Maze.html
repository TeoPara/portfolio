                Creates a perfect maze. A perfect maze is a maze with only one solution, with no loops or closed circuits, and no inaccessible areas.<br>
                The generator uses randomized depth-first search methodology:<br>
                - get adjacent nodes as movement options<br>
                - filter out the movemnet options that are invalid (either already visited or out of bounds)<br>
                - select one randomly to move to<br>
                - otherwise, if there aren't any movemnet options remaining, backtrace<br>
                - if there isn't anything to backtrace to, finish

            This is the rectangular node subclass of the node class.<br>
            The bool values in the two arrays represent all of the sides of the node.<br>
            With hexagonal nodes, you have 6 sides. With rectangular nodes, 4.<br>
            <br>
            <code>Openings</code> is used to store which sides are open/closed and used to determine the proper sprite to draw.<br>
            <code>Went</code> is used to keep track of which sides the path has gone through during generation.<br>
            <code>Position</code> is this node's position on the map.

            This creates a 2D array of the <code>Node</code> class.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 6 & 7</pry> - As opposed to the <code>Array.Length</code> property, the <code>Array.GetLength()</code> method can be used with multidimensional arrays.<br>
            These two for loops cover the entire span of the array..<br>
            <pry>Line 8</pry> - ..and a Node is created at every position. The type of Node depends on the <code>hex</code> parameter.

            This function is used to determine which tile to render. It takes in the bool array of openings that a node has, and converts it into the filename format that the <code>TileBase</code> s are in.
            <code>Resources.Load<>()</code> is used together with the return value of this function in order to select the correct tile. The naming scheme of the tiles looks like this: "-X--", "X-X-", "XXXX", "---X", etc.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 3</pry> - I create an array of '-' characters. The length of the array depends on whether it's a hexagonal node or not.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 5</pry> - I loop from 0 through the arrays length<br>
            <pry>Line 6</pry> - If the bool array has a value of false at the same position,<br>
            <pry>Line 7</pry> - set the character at that position to 'X'<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 9</pry> - Return the result, after converting the character array to a string.<br>
            <br>
            <red>Note: </red><sred>Instead of using the <code>hex</code> parameter to set the <code>for</code> loop's limit, at line 5, I could've just used <code>dirs</code>' length.</sred>

    <!-- Third code example -->
    <div style="display: inline-flex">

            I'll go over the code structure surrounding the main run function.<br>
            <br>
            Here you can see a class, <code>RunInterface</code>, which contains two <code>Action</code> delegates: <code>Cancel</code> and <code>AdjustWaitTime</code>.<br>
            These are meant in order to retroactively manipulate the maze generator as it's busy doing its work before it's actually finished.<br>
            This is possible because the maze generator runs on a coroutine with a delay after each step, rather than doing so instantaneously.<br>
            <br>
            Next up, there's the <code>RunParams</code> struct. This is used as a container for any possible inputs I may want to pass onto the generator, which makes things more manageable.<br>
            Creating a separate place to group a category of your parameters into also brings a good amount of clarity â€” if your function signature looks like an unreadable mess otherwise.

    <!-- Fourth code example -->
    <div style="display: inline-flex">
        <img style="height: 100%; margin-right: 40px;" src="content/mazeCode2.png">
        <p style="margin-top: 0">
            Now for the actual run function itself;<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 1</pry> - The maze generator's logic works inside of a coroutine.<br>
            I use this variable, <code>startedRunCoroutine</code>, to keep a reference to that coroutine, so that I may stop it at any time.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 3</pry> - This function takes three arguments, namely;<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- <code>RunParams runParams</code>: described in the previous section.<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- <code>bool hex</code>: this is whether you're generating a hexagonal maze or not.<br>
            <aaaa style="display: inline-flex">
                <aaa>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-&nbsp;</aaa>
                <aaa><code>Action completionCallback</code>: as the name implies, this delegate is provided by the caller so that it may be invoked when the maze generation process finishes,
                so that the caller may do something upon that event. It's null by default so as not to have to specify an empty delegate every time you want to use this but don't want anything to happen afterwards.</aaa>
            </aaaa><br>
            <br>
            And it returns a <code>RunInterface</code> - which is explained in the previous section.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 5 & 6</pry> - To prevent weird stuff from happening, I make sure only one coroutine is currently active.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 9</pry> - The amount of seconds the coroutine waits for after every step. Its value gets adjusted by a delegate.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 11</pry> - Start the coroutine and assign it as the value for the variable from earlier.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 14-32</pry> - Create a new <code>RunInterface</code> and return it, after defining the delegates.<br>
            <br>
            <pry>Line 34</pry> - The actual coroutine with the maze generation. I've nested it in here because it's not used anywhere else, and shouldn't be.<br>
